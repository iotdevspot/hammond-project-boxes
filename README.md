# hammond-project-boxes

EAGLE design blocks made for Hammond project boxes. I've used AutoCAD to export the proper .dfx files from the factory given 3D models than I imported them to Eagle with the import-dfx ULP. The outline of the box's inner part and the dimensions of the PCB can be seen on the document layer.

### How to use them
* Copy the design blocks (with .dbl extension) to the where they are stored by Eagle. It is usually the following on Windows: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\EAGLE\design blocks
* During the board layout process click on the "Add a Design Block" button then select the desired one. With one click place it where you want and delete the original board dimensions if it's required.
